Version 1.0.0 - March 14, 2016
------------------------------
Initial release, featuring special Logistics Rails that will enable you to turn your regular Cargo Wagons into Logistics Wagons.


Version 1.0.1 - March 15, 2016
------------------------------
Inserters are no longer forcibly disabled in the code; instead, wagons are now barred-out (all slots turned red) when they are interacting with the logistics network.
Wagons are now set to be non-minable and inoperable when interacting with the logistics network.


Version 1.0.2 - March 16, 2016

Fixed a possible bug with requester rails.
